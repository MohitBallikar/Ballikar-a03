/*
Create a program that prompts for your age and your resting heart rate.
Use the Karvonen formula to determine the target heart rate based on a range of intensities from 55% to 95%.
Don’t hard-code the percentages. Use a loop to increment the percentages from 55 to 95.
Ensure that the heart rate and age are entered as numbers. Don’t allow the user to continue without entering valid inputs.
Display the results in a tabular format.
    Formula = TargetHeartRate = (((220 − age) − restingHR) × intensity) + restingHR
Needs to be formatted with the proper hyphens/underscores/pipes
