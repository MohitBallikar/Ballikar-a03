/*
Create a program that prompts for a list of numbers, separated by spaces.
Have the program print out a new list containing only the even numbers.

Convert the input to an array.
Many languages can easily convert strings to arrays with a built-in function that splits apart a string based on a specified delimiter.
Write your own algorithm—don’t rely on the language’s built-in filter or similar enumeration feature.
Use a function called filterEvenNumbers to encapsulate the logic for this.
The function takes in the original array and returns the new array.

Call function and ensure that the input is an array
ensure spaces are accounted for, either in input or output processing
declare even numbers (modulo)
