/* Need to prompt user balance, APR, and monthly payment
n = -(1/30) * log(1 + b/p * (1 - (1 + i)^30)) / log(1 + i) use this formula for calculation in the final value for the number of months needed to pay off
implement this formula with a calculator which takes the inputs and calculates in the back-end
    Prompt for the cardâ€™s APR. Do the division internally.
    Prompt for the APR as a percentage, not a decimal.
    Use a class called PaymentCalculator with a public method called calculateMonthsUntilPaidOff, which takes no parameters and returns the number of months.
    Round fractions of a cent up to the next cent for internal calculations
finally display the data for the user
