/*
Create a program that generates a multiplication table for the numbers 1 through 12 (inclusive).
Use a nested loop to complete this program.
Align each column within the table without using the tab character.

Use two loops:
    One for printing
    One for formatting
Since it is all printing will most likely not need test cases
